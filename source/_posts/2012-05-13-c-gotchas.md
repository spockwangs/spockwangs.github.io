`+`, `-` have higher precedence than `>>`, `<<`.

`a/b` if `a` or `b` is negative, its result is implementation-dependent
(truncated to or from 0) prior to C99, and truncated to 0 by C99.  The
standard specifies that `(a/b)*b + a%b` is equal to `a`.

## Array name vs. pointer

Usually an array name is transformed to be a pointer to the first element
of the array.  But in following situations an array name is not equivalent
to a pointer to the first element of the array:

*  as an operand of `sizeof` operator
*  as an operand of `&` operator

The declaration of an array and its definition must be compatible, only
except as a parameter of a function, in which the declaration of an array
is equivalent to the declaration of a pointer.  Particularly you must not
define a variable to be an array in one file and declare it to be a pointer
in another file.
